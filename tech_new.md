## Teacher Module Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to implement the new `Teacher` module, mirroring the architecture and patterns of the existing `Etudiant` module.

### Modified Files:

- `config/app.php` (Added `TeacherFacade` to aliases)
- `Modules/Teacher/routes/api.php` (Updated with CRUD routes for Teacher)

### Routes Registered:

All routes are prefixed with `/api/teachers`:

- `POST /api/teachers` (StoreTeacherRequest, TeacherController@store)
- `GET /api/teachers/{id}` (TeacherController@show)
- `PUT /api/teachers/{id}` (UpdateTeacherRequest, TeacherController@update)
- `DELETE /api/teachers/{id}` (TeacherController@destroy)

### Important Usage Notes for Integration:

1.  **Database Migrations:** Run `php artisan migrate` to create the `teachers` table in your database. Ensure your `users` table exists and has the necessary fields (`first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `phone`, `password`, `role_id`, `address`, `date_of_birth`, `gender`).
2.  **Role ID:** Teachers are associated with `role_id = 2` in the `users` table.
3.  **API Endpoints:** Use the registered API routes for CRUD operations on teachers.
4.  **Error Handling:** The API returns `409 Conflict` for duplicate email/phone during creation/update, `404 Not Found` if a teacher or user is missing, `201 Created` for successful creation, and `200 OK` for successful fetches/updates.
5.  **Relational Data:** When fetching a teacher, the response will include nested `user` and `user.role` data.
6.  **Composer Autoload:** Ensure your composer autoload is up-to-date by running `composer dump-autoload` after these changes to correctly load the new classes and facades.
